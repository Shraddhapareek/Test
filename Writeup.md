# INFOGRAPHIC
  For infographic, the team decided to take the plot results from component 3(using the UFO Sightings dataset) and make out some story 
  from the observations from the dataset. We used Venngage.com to design the pages of the inforgraphics and then we joined the pages. Venngage is a easy use website where we can design and can create stylish infographics, reports,posters promotions and social media images. The description about the infographics are as following:
  
 ## Infographic- UFO Sightings in United States
   The infographic represents some of the interesting observations from UFO sightings dataset. We took data for only one country that is USA for the infographic.Some of the observations which are displayed in the infographic are:
 * Out of all the records in the dataset, 81% of the sightings records are from USA.
 * The maximum number of sightings are recorded in California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, New York and Washington and these states share their boundaries with the waterbodies that is oceans or lake. This is amusing that why the maximum number of sightings are from these states? Is there any connection between the number of UFO sightings and the states near waterbodies? Is it just a coincidence or something else?
 * The dataset also tells us that the maximum sightings were recorded after sunset and before sunrise in USA, that is in darkness. So, it can be assumed that in absence of sunlight, the waterbodies around these states are dark and the boundaries of the states are full of lights, which attracts UFOs towards these states.
  * Another surprising observation is the states which have maximum number of sightings are the states with maximum number of population.
 * From the above observation, one assumption could be that there is high correlation between the number of population and the number of sightings. This could be the possibility that more people have seen more UFOs resulting in more recordings.
