# INFOGRAPHICS
  For infographics, the team decided to take the plot results from component 3(using the UFO Sightings dataset) and make out some story 
  from the observations from the dataset. We used Venngage.com to design the pages of the inforgraphics and then we joined the pages. Venngage is a easy use website where we can design and can create stylish infographics, reports,posters promotions and social media images. The description about the infographics are as following:
  
 ## Infographic Page- UFO Sightings in United States
   The first page of the infogarphic is the introduction page which represents the number of UFO sightings in USA.
   Some of the obeservation which are displayed in the infographic are:
 * Out of all the records in the dataset, 81% of the sightings records are recorded 
 * The maximum number of sightings are recorded in states which share their boundaries with the water bodies. It is very interesting that the maximum number of sightings are at these states
