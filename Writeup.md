# INFOGRAPHIC
  For infographic, the team decided to take the plot results from component 3(using the UFO Sightings dataset) and make out some story 
  from the observations. We used Venngage.com to design the pages of the inforgraphics and then we joined those pages. Venngage is an easy infographic maker where one can design and can create stylish designs, reports,posters promotions and social media images. The insights from infographic which the team desigined are as follows:
  
 ## Infographic- UFO Sightings in United States
   The infographic represents some of the interesting observations from UFO sightings dataset. We took data for only one country that is USA .Some of the observations which are displayed in the infographic are:
 * Out of all the records in the dataset, 81% of the sighting records are from USA.
 * The maximum number of sightings were recorded in California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, New York and Washington and these states share their boundaries with the waterbodies(oceans or lakes). This is amusing that why the maximum number of sightings are from these states? Is there any connection between the number of UFO sightings and the states near waterbodies? Is it just a coincidence or something else?
 * The dataset also tells us that the time for maximum number of sightings is after sunset and before sunrise in USA, that is in darkness. So, it can be assumed that in absence of sunlight, the waterbodies around these states are dark and the boundaries of the states are full of lights, which attracts UFOs towards these states.
  * Another surprising observation is that the states which have maximum number of sightings are the states with maximum number of population. One assumption could be that the number of population is directly proportional to the number of sightings. This could be the possibility that more people have seen more UFOs resulting in more number of records.
* One of the important findings from component 3 is the high correlation between the number of population and the number of sightings. If we see the maps from page 2, we can see that the states like California is highlighted in dark blue color representing the high number of sightings. But when we normalized the data by year-wise population, we can see that the colour has changed. It is because that per capita sighting is not maximum in the states with maximum number of population. 
* Taking top 5 states with maximum sightings, when we analyzed the number of sightings year wise, we noticed a gradual increase in the number of sightings till year 2012, but after that we noticed a remarkable decrease in the number of sightings. This observation made us think about all the possible reasons for this decline. One of the possible assumptions could be the advanced technology, because of which the efficiency for recognizing UFOs correctly increased with time leading to the actual records of UFOs and not any sort of misinterpretations.

## Strengths and Weaknesses
* While working on the infographic, the best part was the contribution of the team to come up with creative ideas and the analysis done on the dataset. The team used Tableau, to understand the dataset and to get some of the visualizations done.
* The infographic designing platform is very user friendly which gave us freedom of uploading images of our choice. The templates in Venngage are very stylish and gave us freedom to use and change designs of our choice.
* The team contributed equally which was the best part. Out of 3 pages in inforgraphics Shraddha, Aarushi and Aayushi made one-one page each.
* The bad part about the venngage is the limitations for editing things to some extent. Also, there is limitation for uploading the number of images which was kind of disappointing.
* Also, we found some issues in getting visualizations on Tableau.
* The team wanted to get some more comparison based visualizations from the dataset ans still woking on it get some relevant insights to understand the pattern for UFO sightings.
