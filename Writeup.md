# INFOGRAPHIC
* We used UFO dataset for the infographic. 
* https://venngage.com/ was used for designing.
 
 ## Insights included in the Infographic
 * All of our observation are based on data from USA.
 * Out of all the records in the dataset, 81% of the sighting records are from USA.
 * The maximum number of sightings were recorded in California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, New York and Washington. All of these states share borders with water bodies, oceans or lakes. One would wonder the reason for maximum sightings in states adjacent to water bodies? Is it just a coincidence or is there some hidden variable e.g. population or something else? 
* It is infact the case that aforementioned states are most populous. However, when we normalize by population, difference between number of sightings in these states and other states reduces.
* Taking top 5 states with maximum sightings, when we analyzed the number of sightings year wise, we noticed a gradual increase in the number of sightings till year 2012, but after that we noticed a remarkable decrease in the number of sightings. This observation made us think about all the possible reasons for this decline. One of the possible assumptions could be the advanced technology, because of which the efficiency for recognizing UFOs correctly increased with time leading to the actual records of UFOs and not any sort of misinterpretations.
 * Most of the sightings are either after sunset or before sunrise. Most of the reported sightings are also of shape `light`. This makes sense as objects with light will only be seen in darkness. This could also mean that some light emitting objects were misinterpreted as UFOs.

## Strengths and Weaknesses
* While working on the infographic, the best part was the contribution of the team to come up with creative ideas and the analysis done on the dataset. The team used Tableau, to understand the dataset and to get some of the visualizations done.
* The infographic designing platform is very user friendly which gave us freedom of uploading images of our choice. The templates in Venngage are very stylish and gave us freedom to use and change designs of our choice.
* The bad part about the Venngage is the limitations for editing things to some extent. Also, there is limitation for uploading the number of images which was kind of disappointing.

## Contributions
Shraddha, Aarushi and Aayushi designed infographic. Everyone was involved in exploring the dataset and other aspects like deciding which dataset should be used for normalization, should normalization and log tranformation be mutually exclusive etc. These discussions were common to both this part and part three.
