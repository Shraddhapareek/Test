# INFOGRAPHICS
  For infographics, the team decided to take the plot results from component 3(using the UFO Sightings dataset) and make out some story 
  from the observations from the dataset. We used Venngage.com to design the pages of the inforgraphics and then we joined the pages. Venngage is a easy use website where we can design and can create stylish infographics, reports,posters promotions and social media images. The description about the infographics are as following:
  
 ## Infographic- UFO Sightings in United States
   The first page of the infogarphic is the introduction page which represents the number of UFO sightings in USA.
   Some of the obeservation which are displayed in the infographic are:
 * Out of all the records in the dataset, 81% of the sightings records are from USA.
 * The maximum number of sightings are recorded in states which share their boundaries with the water bodies. It is very interesting that the maximum number of sightings are at these states. The states with maximum number of sightings are California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, Newyork and Washington.
 * This interesting observation about the sightings made us wonder that why the sightings are more in the states which share their boundaries with waterbodies. Is it just a coincidence or something else.
 * The dataset tells us that the maximum sightings were recorded after sunset and before sunrise in USA, that is in darkness. So, it can be assumed that in darkness the waterbodies around the states are dark in night and the boundaries of the above mentioned states are full of lights, which attracts UFOs towards themselves.
